# Games

#### Unlocked

This means that the game files are ripped from e.g. Steam, what it also means is that you can't wait for a crack and copy it into the dir because the files are still encrypted. These are worthless uploads and only interesting for those who want to decrypt the files and crack the game.


# Movies

#### Telesync (TS)

TS uses an external audio source, the overall quality is low and not worth to watch it. A  direct audio source does not ensure a good quality audio source, as a  lot of background noise can interfere. A lot of the times a telesync is  filmed in an empty cinema or from the projection booth with a  professional camera, giving a better picture quality. 


#### Telecine (TC)

A telecine machine copies the film digitally from the reels.

#### VHSRip

I don't think there will be any VHS rips anymore, but to explain it mainly skating/sports videos and XXX releases from VHS.


##### Screener (SCR)

A pre VHS tape, sent to rental stores, and various  other places for promotional use. A screener is supplied on a VHS tape,  and is usually in a 4:3 (full screen), although letterboxed screeners are sometimes found. 


##### DVD-Screener (DVDscr)

Same premise as a screener, but transferred off a DVD. Usually transferred to SVCD or DivX/XviD.


##### DVDRip

A copy of the final released DVD. If possible this is released PRE retail again, should be decent quality.

##### HDTV

HDTV or PDTV or DTH (Direct To Home) rips often come from Over-the-Air transmissions. HDTV sources are re-encoded to multiple resolutions such as 640×352 (360p), 960×528 (540p), and 1280×720 (720p)  at various file sizes for pirated releases. 

##### TVRip

TV episode that is either from Network (capped using digital cable/satellite boxes are preferable) or PRE-AIR from satellite feeds sending the program around to networks a few days earlier. 


##### Workprint (WP)

A workprint is a copy of the film that has not been finished.

##### DivX Re-Enc

Taken from its original VCD source and re-encoded into a small DivX file.


##### R5

The R5 is a retail DVD from region 5. Region 5 consists of India, Africa (except Egypt, South Africa, Swaziland, and Lesotho), Russia and former USSR countries. 


##### WEB – DL

This is a movie or TV show downloaded via an on-line distribution website (web download), such as iTunes/Google Play Store etc.


##### WEBRip

This is a file ripped from a DRM-free streaming service, such as Hulu, CrunchyRoll or WWE Network. The quality is comparable to WEB-DL, but bitrates are lower to save on streaming bandwidth.


##### Watermarks

A lot of films come from Asian Silvers & PDVD and these are tagged by the people responsible. 


##### Asian Silvers / PDVD

These are films put out by eastern bootleggers, and these are usually  bought by some groups to put out as their own.


##### BRRIP and BDRIPs

These BRRip XviD and BDRip XviD files allow anyone to burn HD-quality  Blu-Ray ripped movies on regular DVD media without been re-encoded or extra DVD authoring.


##### BRRip

A BD/BRRip in DVD-Rip size often looks better than a same-size DVD rip because encoders have better source material.


##### BDRip

An XviD encode directly from a source Blu-Ray disk. BRRip's are encoded from a pre-release, usually from a 1080p BDRip from another group.
